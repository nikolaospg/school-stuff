## Theta QAM (June 2020)
It is a simulation of a telecommunication system using [Theta QAM](https://users.auth.gr/geokarag/pdf/Theta.pdf). The scripts involve computing the BER,SER and making the appropriate plots.
## Data Analysis (Jan 2021)
The project involves data taken from [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).
At first, some statistical analysis is included, mainly focusing on fitting distribution objects to the data of some countries, testing on whether the peak of the deaths is actually 14 days later than the peak of the daily cases (using hypothesis testing and correlation analysis) and so on. 
Then regression analysis takes place, in trying to predict the daily deaths using data for the daily Cases. Predictions on the second wave based on data from the first wave are also made (using multiple linear models, stepwise and lasso regression).
