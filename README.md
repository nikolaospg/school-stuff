Some Assignments I have done for school  
## Data Analytics (Jan 2021)
The project involves data taken from [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).  
At first, some statistical analysis is included, mainly focusing on fitting distribution objects to the data of some countries, testing on whether the peak of the deaths is actually 14 days later than the peak of the daily cases (using hypothesis testing and correlation analysis) and so on. 
Then regression analysis takes place, in trying to predict the daily deaths using data for the daily Cases. Predictions on the second wave based on data from the first wave are also made (using multiple linear models, stepwise and lasso regression).
## DIP (Spring 2021)
Consists of three exercises on the Digital Image Processing Course.   
The first includes implementing a Bayer to Truecolor conversion algorithm, image resampling techniques (Nearest Neighbour and Bilinear Interpolation), Quantising/Dequantising and finally saving using PPM format.  
The second includes image segmentation, by implementing Spectral Clustering, Normalised cuts and recursive Normalised Cuts techniques.  
The third includes implementing a SIFT detector.  
## SMDS (Spring 2021)
Includes two exercises for the Course of Simulation and Modelling of Dynamical Systems.  
In the first, we use Newton's and Kirchhoff's Laws to create Linear regression Models to describe dynamical systems (Mass/Spring/Damper and an electrical circuit). Then using OLS and simulation to estimate some parameters and check how the systems behave.  
In the second, we get some State space models of LTI systems and by using continuous time Gradient Descent and Lyapunov (Parallel and Series-Parallel) based estimation methods we achieve online parameter estimation.  
## Fuzzy Systems (Spring 2021)
Includes two exercises for the Computational Intelligence Course.  
In the first after designing a classical PID controller, I use a Mamdani FIS to create an FZ-PI controller.  
In the second one I use an ANFIS to solve a regression problem. I use a grid search for the optimisation of some hyperparameters, feature selection and both subtractive clustering and grid partitioning for the rule initialisation. 
## Theta QAM (June 2020)
It is a simulation of a telecommunication system using [Theta QAM](https://users.auth.gr/geokarag/pdf/Theta.pdf). The scripts involve computing the BER,SER and making the appropriate plots.
